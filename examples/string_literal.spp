str hello world     ; allocates a chunk of memory and saves the chars in it. Then pushes the size of the string and the pointer to the stack

pop a       ; get the size (we don't really need it)
pop b       ; get the pointer to the string

move b f1   ; put the ptr in 'f1'

call print  ; print the string
